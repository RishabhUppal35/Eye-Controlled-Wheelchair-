# Eye-Controlled-Wheelchair-

Our Aim is to a design a Smart Wheelchair which will help the person suffering from 
any physical disabilities to be able to move independently; regardless of anyone’s assistance.
Our project is an attempt to make lives of the people suffering from quadriplegia phenomenon 
simple and by simpler, we mean self-reliant, which will thereby reinstate their confidence and 
their happiness. The person who wants to operate our smart wheelchair system will be able to 
do so by using movement of his/her eyes to move the wheelchair. The idea is to create an Eye 
Monitored System which allows movement of the patient’s wheelchair depending on the eye 
movements. We have created a device where a patient sitting on the Wheelchair assembly 
looking directly at the camera, is able to move in a direction just by looking in that direction.

•	Scripted a Python program for face detection using Voila-Jones algorithm.
•	Utilized Hough Transform to extract Iris from eyes acquiring input from a webcam and processing data in MATLAB with 0.5ms of delay.
•	Generated signals by Arduino to run motor driver and resulted the project’s success rate with 80% of accuracy.
